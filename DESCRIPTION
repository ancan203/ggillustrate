Description: Transforms ggplot2 charts into AI-generated illustrated visuals while 
    preserving statistical relationships. Uses OpenAI's image editing capabilities 
    to enhance data visualizations with metaphorical and artistic elements, making 
    data communication more engaging and accessible without compromising analytical 
    integrity. Seamlessly integrates with existing ggplot2 workflows through a 
    single function call.
